# Maintenance Scripts

This folder stores one-off maintenance and troubleshooting scripts that are not part of the runtime service.

- `check_sectors.py`
- `bootstrap_market_data.py`
- `dedup_stock_mentions.py`
- `find_topic.py`
- `fix_topic_id.py`
- `fix_topic_id_v2.py`
- `search_text.py`

These scripts are intentionally separated from the project root to keep the main codebase focused on production modules.
